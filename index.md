# Welcome!

![Moustache Not Included]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/moi.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

You have entered the personal webpage of Jacob Miller, a physics PhD graduate and general curious character with an interest in math, science, computers, and everything in between. My graduate research under [Dr. Akimasa Miyake](https://cquic.unm.edu/miyake-group/) involved finding manifestations of the concept of phase of matter (like solid, liquid, gas, etc.) in the realm of quantum computers, something which left me with a wide-ranging technical toolbox and an unconventional research viewpoint. I'm trying to bring some of those perspectives into the curious world of deep learning, and am [currently on the hunt]({{site.baseurl}}/work.html) for workplaces with a welcoming environment where I can apply these ideas at scale.

I'm also a big fan of [travel]({{site.baseurl}}/travel.html), and love story-worthy adventures, trying things for the first time, and meeting people from different backgrounds than me. I have a lot of scattered interest, and my hope is to share more of them here in the future. Anyhow, feel free to browse around, and [let me know](mailto:jmjacobmiller@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
