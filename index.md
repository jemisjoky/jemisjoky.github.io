I'm Jacob Miller, an AI researcher (and physicist by training) working on tensor-based machine learning. I did my PhD under [Dr. Akimasa Miyake](https://cquic.unm.edu/miyake-group/), where I applied tensor network tools to create novel quantum computing algorithms based on topological phases of matter (think "solid, liquid, gas", and then generalize some).

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), working with [Dr. Guillaume Rabusseau](https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~grabus/), where I devise new machine learning models powered by tensorial tools. Seeing how ideas from physics can take on new life within AI has been inspirational, and I invite you to check out some of the [research we've been working on]({{site.baseurl}}/research.html) :)
