## East Asia (Backpacking trip, 2018)

I've been interested in Asia for a long time, ever since my childhood pretending to do kung fu in the woods of Vermont. As I got older these interests turned more towards China, especially following a semester-long Mandarin immersion program in Beijing during college. After finishing grad school 7 years later, I had a wonderful opportunity to do some extended traveling, and was dying to get back to Asia once more. After wrapping up a motorcycle trip in Fall 2017, I headed out in January 2018 for Taiwan, which was my jumping off point for a lovely four month romp around East Asia. I biked around Taiwan, saw old friends in South Korea and Japan, and spent a long time meandering through China and learning more about its long and fascinating history.

After eventually returning to the US, I had a fun time giving a presentation about the whole trip at our [local library](https://starksborolibrary.wordpress.com/), with the [slideshow]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/east_asia_slideshow.pdf) from that available above. The slides don't do much storytelling on their own, but do have some good pictures from the trip and at least give a sense of the what and where.

## US and Canada (Motorcycle trip, 2017)

After completing grad school I decided to take a "gap year" to travel, catch up with the important people in my life, and think long and hard about future career plans. As a means to these ends I bought a motorcycle shortly after graduation, and went on a long, winding road trip across the US and Canada during August-November 2017. Although the trip started and ended in Vermont, it covered a lot of ground in between, with the whole thing totaling around 14,000 miles. Some highlights include seeing my first eclipse in Wyoming, taking part in my friends' wedding in New Mexico (also a first), and helping with hurricane recovery in the Florida Keys.

There were lots of highs and lows along the trip (both metaphorical and geographical), but more than anything else it was an amazing opportunity to grow closer to scattered friends and family, while spending time in some gorgeous natural places along the way. There's no question that taking time off to think things through and reconnect with myself, in lieu of the "obvious" move of just jumping into the next professional role, was the right decision for me, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in a similar situation who can manage to make it work. You won't regret it, trust me :)
