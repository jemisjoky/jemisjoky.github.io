# Looking for Work!

![Diploma man]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/finish_line.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

Are you an employer with a focus on deep learning and a desire for new ideas? I'm currently on the market, and am looking for a workplace with a friendly atmosphere and difficult, open-ended problems to work on. I'm still a bit undecided between employment in industry vs. academia, but either way am excited about getting to work with interesting machine learning models at a larger scale. You can find the relevant information in [my resume]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cv.pdf), but here are some noteworthy highlights: `<shameless plug>`

* I got my PhD in 2017 doing work which earned the Chair's Award for [best UNM physics dissertation](https://cquic.unm.edu/cquic-news/chairs-award-or-best-dissertation-in-physics/) of the year.

* I have a proven research track record, having published four first author papers in grad school, [half of](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.120506) [which](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.170503) appeared in the well-regarded[^prl] journal _Physical Review Letters_.

* I'm good at explaining difficult concepts to others, and won the William G. Larsen Award for best graduate physics/math TA in 2012 for my teaching.

* I have a solid intuition for making systems accessible to a broader user base, largely owing to a design-heavy undergraduate engineering education at Olin College.

* I'm reasonably fluent in Mandarin, which is professionally valuable every now and again.

`</shameless plug>` If any of this seems like a good fit for your workplace, feel free to [shoot me a message](mailto:jmjacobmiller@gmail.com) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
