# Looking for Work!

![Diploma man]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/finish_line.jpg){:height="50%" width="50%"}

Are you an employer with a focus on machine learning and a desire for new ideas? I'm currently on the market, and am looking for a workplace with a friendly atmosphere and challenging, open-ended problems to work on. I'm open to employment in both industry and academia, wherever will allow me to analyze the behavior of machine learning models at a large scale. You can find all the details in [my resume]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/resume.pdf), but here are some quick highlights: `<shameless plug>`

* My PhD research earned the Chair's Award for [best UNM physics dissertation](https://cquic.unm.edu/cquic-news/chairs-award-or-best-dissertation-in-physics/) of 2017.

* I have a strong research track record, having written four first author papers in grad school, [half of](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.120506) [which](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.170503) were published in the well-respected _Physical Review Letters_.

* I'm good at making difficult concepts accessible to others, and earned the William G. Larsen Award for best graduate physics/math TA in 2012 for my teaching.

* I have a solid knack for user design, largely coming from a design-heavy undergraduate education at Olin College.

* I'm pretty fluent in Mandarin, having spent five month in an intensive language in Beijing during 2010 and four months in 2018 backpacking around East Asia.
