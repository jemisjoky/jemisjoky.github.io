I'm Jacob Miller, a kid with a bubbly personality and a whole slew of interests. I've been a nerd practically since birth, a tendency further spurred on by an engineering education at [Olin College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olin_College) and a graduate career studying [exotic architectures](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/phyc_etds/149/) for quantum computation. Although the details and focus of my technical interests have changed as I've grown, my guiding light has always been a complete fascination with the definite yet elusive link tying together abstract mathematical models and the real-world complexities they attempt to describe. More recently, this fascination has turned me towards the world of machine learning, where I'm [hell-bent]({{site.baseurl}}/work.html) on developing useful theoretical frameworks to better categorize the diverse behavior encountered in modern deep learning research.

I also have interests that don't involve math or science or computers. I travel a lot, and view the whole enterprise as a great opportunity to meet humanity in all our wonderfully many forms. I'm a bit of a nerd about Chinese history, culture, and language, and recently completed a four month [backpacking and language immersion trip]({{site.baseurl}}/travel.html) through East Asia. I love dancing to good music, drinking good tea, and spending time with those who are near and dear to me.

## What's with the website name?

I'm a James Joyce fan, and encountered this unlikely statement while reading (okay, more like skimming) the epic [_Finnegans Wake_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake):

> Shem is short for Shemus as Jem is joky for Jacob.

The phrase "_Jem is joky for Jacob_" struck me as an incredible coincidence, since my initials are JEM, my given name is Jacob, and I'm rather a joky fellow. And thus _jemisjoky_ was born.
