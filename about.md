I'm Jacob Miller, a kid with a bubbly personality and a wide range of interests. I've had a huge love for math and science for as long as I can remember, and that passion has led me to pursue engineering in college, quantum computation and physics in grad school, and now computer science and machine learning in my working life. That may sound eclectic, but my guiding light has always been a fascination with the interface between abstract mathematical models and the real-world complexities they hope to capture. These considerations stand at the heart of science, and are something I've been lucky to work on at length throughout my career.

On a different note, I've also had a steady interest in East Asia ever since I was a little kid pretending to do kung fu in the woods of Vermont. As I've gotten older, those interests have largely revolved around Chinese history and culture, and being able to study Mandarin for 5 months in Beijing during college really helped broaden my horizons on that front. After completing my phd in physics, I embarked on a 4 month backpacking and language immersion trip through Taiwan, mainland China, South Korea, and Japan, where I met a lot of new friends and reaffirmed my interest of East Asian history, culture, and politics.

And now it's on to the next adventure, this time into the beautiful and sublime weirdness of deep learning. I'm still a pretty new to the field, but am picking it up as I go, spurred on by the mind-blowing applications of the subject. And what's even better, there's still _a lot_ of interesting work to be done. Watch out world, here we come!

## What's with the website name?

Oh yeah, I'm a big James Joyce fan. The first time I started wading through Finnegans Wake, Joyce's [madcap masterpiece](http://www.trentu.ca/faculty/jjoyce/fw-3.htm), I stumbled across the line,

> Shem is short for Shemus as Jem is joky for Jacob.

The phrase "_Jem is joky for Jacob_" struck me as an incredible coincidence, since my initials are JEM, my given name is Jacob, and I'm pretty joky (as far as Jacobs go). This website won't capture all of that, but my overriding hope is that, as Joyce put it,

> Putting truth and untruth together a shot may be made at what this hybrid actually was like to look at.
